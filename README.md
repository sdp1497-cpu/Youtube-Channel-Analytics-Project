# 🎥 YouTube Channel Analytics Project 📊

This project is a comprehensive analysis of five distinct YouTube channels, focusing on key metrics such as **subscriber numbers**, **view counts**, and **number of videos**. By utilizing the **YouTube API** and advanced **data visualization methodologies**, this project reveals patterns and trends in viewer engagement, providing insights into the performance and audience behavior of the channels.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The project aims to analyze YouTube channel performance by:
- **Extracting key metrics** (subscriber count, view count, video count) using **web scraping** and **YouTube API**.
- **Visualizing** these metrics to uncover trends and patterns in audience engagement.
- Offering a **deeper understanding** of how different YouTube channels perform and how their audience interacts with content.

## 📦 Key Features

- **YouTube API Integration**: Automatically fetches real-time data for each of the selected YouTube channels.
- **Web Scraping**: Additional data is collected from publicly available information on the web to supplement the API results.
- **Advanced Data Visualization**: Utilizes libraries like **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** to present the data in engaging and interactive formats.
- **Channel Comparison**: Directly compares the metrics across different channels to identify patterns in growth and audience retention.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **Python** 🐍
- **YouTube API**: For real-time data extraction.
- **BeautifulSoup**: For web scraping.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization and plotting.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - The project starts by using the **YouTube API** to gather key metrics such as subscriber counts, view counts, and the number of videos for each channel.
   - **Web scraping** is employed to gather additional information, if necessary.

2. **Data Cleaning & Processing**:
   - The extracted data is cleaned and transformed using **Pandas** to ensure it is ready for analysis.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Advanced data visualization techniques are applied to present the extracted data. This includes line charts, bar charts, and interactive visualizations to help highlight trends and engagement patterns.

4. **Insights & Analysis**:
   - The visualized data is analyzed to uncover key insights, such as:
     - Which channels are growing the fastest.
     - How views correlate with subscriber growth.
     - Audience behavior in relation to the number of videos uploaded.

## 📊 Visualizations Include:

- **Subscriber Growth Over Time** 📈: Shows the growth trends for each channel.
- **View Count Comparisons** 👁️: Highlights the differences in video viewership across channels.
- **Video Count Analysis** 🎥: Illustrates how the number of uploaded videos relates to the overall performance.
- **Engagement Metrics** 💬: Examines patterns in audience interaction, such as comments, likes, and shares.
